### Bootstrap 4
By far the largest dependency, Bootstrap 4, is the framework we chose to use. We encourage anyone unfamiliar with Bootstrap 4 to bookmark and reference their extensive documentation [here](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/layout/overview/).

Our default.ascx, header and footer partials show proper use of bootstrap and its layout classes. Bootstrap 4 is robust, powerful, and has all the bells and whistles that most websites need.

Font Awesome is easy to use, and has an icon for almost everything. You can find the list of icons [here](http://fontawesome.io/icons/).
